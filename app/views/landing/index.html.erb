  <p>Hi, if you're reading this then you probably know me. But, if not, I'm Matt and I read a lot of books. A few people became interested in the things I was reading, and I would tell them about it. But I noticed the I would start to forget details and would find myself spewing off the same bits of info.</p>
  <p>So I decided to start this site to go over all of the books I read. I decided this for two reasons. 1) It will help reinforce the important points in my brain and 2) If someone doesn't feel like reading the entire 200-400 page book, they can get just get the gist of it and decide if it'll actually be worth checking out.</p>
  <p>So.... Welcome. I guess</p>
